                    <p>
                        I contributed to the search, analysis, and implementation of technologies that best suited the
                        development.
                        The first step was to gather and analyze the collected requirements, then search for the
                        technologies to create a comparative chart of their advantages and disadvantages, with the goal
                        of presenting conclusions and proposals.

                        After presenting the proposal, it was adapted according to the non-functional requirements.

                        During the first phase, the design and initial coding of the web system began using <em
                            class="code">Python</em>, <em class="code">Django</em>, and several libraries for data
                        handling and report generation; <em class="code">PostgreSQL</em> was used for data persistence.
                        The frontend consisted of <em class="code">HTML</em>, <em class="code">CSS</em>, and <em
                            class="code">jQuery</em>. For the backend, a <em class="code">RESTful API</em> was
                        implemented using <em class="code">Django Rest Framework</em>.

                        It is worth mentioning that the scenarios were modeled in <em class="code">Blender</em> with 3D
                        objects, specifically those used for protection against electrical discharges, which were
                        created in the research laboratory.

                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first challenge for me was learning a new language, understanding and using a framework along with its libraries.
It wasn't just about learning a new language or technology, but also optimizing response time. Since simulating the areas built by the user and rendering them in the browser took too long, it forced me to look for improvements in the project in terms of optimization, factoring, and searching for libraries that would help reduce the response time.
